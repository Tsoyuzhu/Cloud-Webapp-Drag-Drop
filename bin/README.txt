Hi! Thanks for taking the time to look at my submission. 
In order to execute the app via terminal navigate to the bin directory and execute the bash script 'run.sh' with:

./run.sh

The script will assume pip3 and python3 are already installed and will install flask onto your computer.
The script wil then execute run.py using python3 which will launch the application on localhost:9393 
Copy and paste the http link into your browser and hit enter. 
The app rejects a file upload if there is already a file with identical name in the uploads folder.

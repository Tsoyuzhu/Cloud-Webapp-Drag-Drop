Hello! Thanks for taking the time to look at my submission.
Please execute install.sh first in order to ensure your computer has the necessary packages to run the app.
The only requirements are python3 and flask. After that execute run.sh to launch the app.
The script wil execute run.py using python3 which will run the application on localhost:9393 
The app rejects a file upload if there is already a file with identical name in the uploads directory. 
There is a file initially in the uploads directory to ensure that it will be uploaded to git.
If the bash scripts do not run correctly then as last resort the app can be run from the directory containing run.py 
with the command:
python3 run.py

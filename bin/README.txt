Hello! Thanks for taking the time to look at my submission.
Please execute install.sh first in order to ensure your computer has the necessary packages to run the app.
After that execute run.sh to launch the app.
The script wil execute run.py using python3 which will run the application on localhost:9393 
The app rejects a file upload if there is already a file with identical name in the uploads folder.
